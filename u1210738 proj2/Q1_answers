3.1 Part One:

Q1:

rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ echo Hostname: $HOSTNAME
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ echo Username: $USER
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ echo Shell: $SHELL
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ echo Home Directory: $HOME
-------------------------------

Q2:

I tried doing this on .bash_profile using this way (But it wasn't available 
every time I logged in or opened a new shell):

rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ cp .bash_profile .save_bash_profile
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ vi .bash_profile

Then we go to the .bash_profile file and write the command for the alias, which is:
alias mypass="cat /etc/passwd"

After writing inside the .bash_profile
I saved the file and closed it by pressing 'Esc' , then typing ':wq' , then pressing
'enter'.

I applied the changes by sourcing the file (By typing the following in the terminal):
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ source ~/.bash_profile

Then, we can use the alias by typing its name in the terminal:
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ mypass

which will give us the result as if we wrote : cat /etc/passwd

--> Because it was not available every time I logged in or opened a new shell
I made it on .bashrc (like this): 

rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ vi .bashrc 

Then I wrote this alias inside .bashrc file:
alias mypass="cat /etc/passwd"

Then, we can use the alias by typing its name in the terminal:
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ mypass

--> Note: Pictures of both cases are attached.
-------------------------------

Q3:

rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ ps -f | sort -k2 -n

-------------------------------

Q4:

1) What is the difference between nice and renice commands?

-The nice command is used to start a new process with a specified priority.

-By default, processes start with a nice value of 0.

-You can increase the nice value to lower the process's priority, making it "nicer"
to other processes by consuming less CPU time.

-If you give a process a higher priority, the kernel will allocate more CPU time to that process.In contrast, if you increase the nice value, the process will receive less CPU time,
making it "nicer" to other processes.

--------
-The renice command is used to change the priority of an already running process.
this allows you to adjust the priority of a process that is currently active.

-Linux kernel schedules the process and allocates CPU time accordingly for each of them.
By using the renice command, you can modify the priority of a running process, which in turn
affects the amount of CPU time allocated to it.

-In summary, the renice command provides a way to dynamically adjust the priority of a 
running process, giving you more control over how system resources are allocated.

------

2) Give a usage example for each of them:

First I do this: (to display a long list of currently running processes) 
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ ps -l 

--> Example of nice command:
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ nice -6 ps -l

--> Example of renice command:
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ renice +5 4589

Then I run (ps -l) again to see the changes that occurred after using the renice command: 
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ ps -l
 
-------------------------------

Q5:

The command is:
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ kill -15 $(jobs -p)

--> Below is an example of how I tried it and used it:
First: inside 'vi fore' file I wrote the following:

while true
do  
echo running > my1
done

After writing inside the 'fore' file, I saved the file and closed it by pressing 'Esc', then
typing ':wq', then pressing 'enter'

Then on the terminal, I created 6 jobs on foreground, Using the following:
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ ./fore
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ ./fore
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ ./fore
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ ./fore
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ ./fore
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ ./fore

 
I used command 'jobs' to display jobs like this:
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ jobs

After that, I moved these jobs to the backgroung like this:
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ bg %1
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ bg %2
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ bg %3
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ bg %4
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ bg %5
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ bg %6

I used the command 'jobs' to display jobs like this:
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ jobs

After that, I used this command:
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ jobs -p

(This command lists the process IDs (PIDs) of all backgroung jobs in the current shell)

Then this command that terminates all these background processes at once using the kill command:
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ kill -15 $(jobs -p)

-------------------------------

Q6:

The command is:
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ pkill -9 xeyes

First, I installed the xeyes command
Then, in the terminal, I run the xeyes command about 30 times in the background
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ xeye&
(30 times)


Then I used the 'jobs' command to view jobs like this:
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ jobs

Then the command that kills all xeyes processes in one command:
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ pkill -9 xeyes

Then I used the 'jobs' command to view jobs like this (to make sure they are all killed): 
rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ jobs

3.2 Part Two:

Q1:

rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ find /dev -type c > u1210738\ proj2/files/character_output.txt 

Explanation:
find /dev : starts searching from the /dev directory
-type c : specifies that we're looking for character divice files.
> u1210738\ proj2/files/character_output.txt : redirects the output to the specified file.

-------------------------------

Q2:

rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ find / -type d -print > u1210738\ proj2/files/directories.txt 2> u1210738\ proj2/files/errors.txt

-------------------------------

Q3:

rere-h37@rere-h37-VirtualBox:~$ find /etc -type d -name '[e-l]*' | wc -l
